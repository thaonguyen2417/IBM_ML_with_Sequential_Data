# IBM_ML_with_Sequential_Data

Sequential modelling is the process of forecasting a sequence of values from a set of input values. Input values can contain elements that are ordered into sequences like time-series, text streams, or DNA sequences. Lot of tasks can be modelled from these types of data. 

For example:
text classification, e.g. spam email or not

language translation, e.g. French to English

time-series forecasting, e.g. stock prices prediction



In this guided project, we will look into various common sequential data sets, and understand pre-processing techniques associated with each. Since we will be using simple methods, no prior knowledge in machine learning will be required to complete this guided project.
